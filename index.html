<h2>About My "Hobby"</h2>
<p>I currently do not have any major hobbies, but I would like to look into indoor rock climbing. It seems very intresting and I will most likley start it very soon.</p>

<h3>Fun Facts about climbing</h3>
<p> From what I know so far, Unlike running or high-intensity interval training (HIIT), climbing is low-impact, meaning it's easier on your joints. This makes it a great option for people recovering from injuries or those looking for a sustainable way to stay fit.</p>
